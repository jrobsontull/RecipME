# RecipME
A light-weight, web-based recipe manager written with React. The purpose of this web app was an exercise to learn the **MERN stack** as well as developing an app which will be useful to me. A working version can be found on **Heroku** at this link: [https://recipme-mern.herokuapp.com/](https://recipme-mern.herokuapp.com/).

I started the process of creating this app by drawing the wireframes in Figma. This allowed me to develop the style of the interface and think about how user flow will work.
